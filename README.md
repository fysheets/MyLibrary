# MyLibrary
Test Project for My Library Front End

Ideally a network to show what books you have in your library and connect with others to share books / book club.

Goal is to integrate this front end with Material Design Lite and leverage AngularJS framework.  Will likely create another repo to create and manage any server work that will be integrated with this as a phase 2.
